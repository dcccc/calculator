# Calculator
A calculator/operator to operate gromacs and orca, which makes simulation with gromacs much easier. And a workflow protocal realized based operator. The workflow allows us to do the simulation by using a dict. The dict in which key parameters, force fields and structures are included, then the whole simulation will be conducted one by one automaticaly. 

As to the mathod of using those tools, please refer to the workflow test cases in example folder ( gromacs(https://github.com/dcccc/calculator/blob/main/example/gromacs/workflow_test.ipynb) and orca(https://github.com/dcccc/calculator/blob/main/example/orca/orca_test.ipynb) ).



# Todo

The calculators/operators for quantum espresso.
